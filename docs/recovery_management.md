# Recovery Management System

The Recovery Management System is a critical component of the Self-Improving RAG System that handles validation failures and maintains system stability. It works in conjunction with the Pattern Recognition System to identify appropriate recovery strategies and execute them effectively.

## Overview

The system provides automated recovery mechanisms for different types of validation failures:

1. **Critical Failures**: High-confidence validation failures that require immediate rollback
2. **Pattern-Based Failures**: Issues that match known patterns and can be handled with specific strategies
3. **Isolated Failures**: One-off issues that require incremental fixes

## Components

### Recovery Strategy

The system supports four main recovery strategies:

1. **Rollback**: Restores the system to a previous valid state
   - Used for critical failures
   - Highest priority
   - Requires knowledge map and validation history

2. **Incremental Fix**: Makes targeted changes to resolve specific issues
   - Used for semantic patterns and isolated issues
   - Medium priority
   - Requires knowledge map

3. **Revalidation**: Performs targeted revalidation of specific components
   - Used for temporal patterns
   - Medium priority
   - Requires validation system

4. **Manual Intervention**: Requests human intervention for complex issues
   - Used when automated strategies are insufficient
   - Lowest priority
   - Asynchronous process

### Recovery Action

Each recovery action includes:

- `strategy`: The selected recovery strategy
- `description`: Human-readable description of the action
- `priority`: Priority level (1-5, with 1 being highest)
- `estimated_impact`: Expected impact (0-1, with 1 being highest)
- `required_resources`: List of required system resources
- `metadata`: Additional action-specific information

### Recovery Management Service

The `RecoveryManagementService` provides:

1. **Failure Analysis**:
   - Analyzes validation failures
   - Considers validation history
   - Identifies appropriate recovery strategies

2. **Recovery Execution**:
   - Executes recovery actions
   - Manages concurrent recoveries
   - Tracks recovery history

3. **Pattern Integration**:
   - Works with Pattern Recognition System
   - Uses pattern insights for strategy selection
   - Adapts strategies based on pattern significance

## Usage

```python
from src.services.recovery_management import RecoveryManagementService

# Initialize service
service = RecoveryManagementService(pattern_recognition_service)

# Analyze failure
action = service.analyze_failure(validation_result, validation_history)

# Execute recovery
success = service.execute_recovery(action, {
    "knowledge_map": knowledge_map,
    "validation_system": validation_system
})
```

## Configuration

The service can be configured with:

- `critical_failure_threshold`: Threshold for critical failures (default: 0.8)
- `pattern_significance_threshold`: Minimum pattern significance (default: 0.7)
- `max_concurrent_recoveries`: Maximum concurrent recoveries (default: 3)

## Integration

The Recovery Management System integrates with:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Uses pattern insights for strategy selection
2. **Validation System**: Executes revalidation strategies
3. **Knowledge Map**: Applies fixes and rollbacks
4. **Validation History**: Tracks recovery attempts and outcomes

## Example Recovery Actions

### Critical Failure Recovery
```python
RecoveryAction(
    strategy=RecoveryStrategy.ROLLBACK,
    description="Critical failure recovery for: Technical level mismatch",
    priority=1,
    estimated_impact=1.0,
    required_resources=["knowledge_map", "validation_history"],
    metadata={
        "confidence_score": 0.9,
        "issue_count": 1
    }
)
```

### Pattern-Based Recovery
```python
RecoveryAction(
    strategy=RecoveryStrategy.REVALIDATION,
    description="Pattern-based revalidation for: Recurring prerequisite issues",
    priority=2,
    estimated_impact=0.75,
    required_resources=["validation_system"],
    metadata={
        "pattern_type": "temporal",
        "pattern_significance": 0.8,
        "pattern_occurrences": 3
    }
)
```

## Future Improvements
