# RAG System Enhancement: User Stories and Scenarios

## Phase 1: Foundation Enhancement

### Knowledge Creation Stories

**Story 1: Knowledge Map Generation**
```
As a system user
I want the system to analyze use cases and create a knowledge map
So that I can understand what knowledge needs to be created and in what order

Acceptance Criteria:
Scenario: Creating a knowledge map for a new use case
    Given a new use case is provided
    When the system analyzes the use case
    Then it should identify required document types
    And determine dependencies between documents
    And create a generation sequence
    And specify validation criteria for each document type

Scenario: Validating knowledge map completeness
    Given a knowledge map has been generated
    When the system validates the map
    Then it should confirm all required topics are covered
    And verify dependency relationships are valid
    And ensure no circular dependencies exist
```

**Story 2: Structured Knowledge Generation**
```
As a system user
I want knowledge to be generated in a structured, dependency-aware manner
So that information is complete and consistent

Scenario: Generating dependent documents
    Given a knowledge map with dependencies
    When generating new documents
    Then documents should be created in dependency order
    And each document should reference required predecessors
    And maintain consistency with existing documents

Scenario: Handling generation failures
    Given a document generation fails
    When the system detects the failure
    Then it should retry with modified parameters
    And if still failing, request human intervention
    And maintain system stability throughout
```

### Quality Assurance Stories

**Story 3: Comprehensive Validation**
```
As a system maintainer
I want all generated content to be thoroughly validated
So that we maintain high quality and consistency

Scenario: Multi-level content validation
    Given new content has been generated
    When the validation process runs
    Then it should check for accuracy
    And verify consistency with existing content
    And validate against use case requirements
    And ensure proper formatting and structure

Scenario: Handling validation failures
    Given content fails validation
    When the system detects validation issues
    Then it should categorize the issues
    And attempt automated fixes where possible
    And escalate complex issues for review
```

**Story 4: State Management**
```
As a system operator
I want full visibility and control of system state
So that I can ensure reliability and recover from issues

Scenario: Tracking state changes
    Given an operation is performed
    When the state changes
    Then all changes should be recorded
    And previous state should be preserved
    And state transition should be validated

Scenario: State recovery
    Given a system issue occurs
    When recovery is needed
    Then previous valid state should be restorable
    And all dependencies should be maintained
    And system integrity should be verified
```

## Phase 2: Intelligence Enhancement

### Pattern Recognition Stories

**Story 5: Problem Pattern Recognition**
```
As a system maintainer
I want the system to recognize patterns in issues
So that we can implement systematic improvements

Scenario: Identifying recurring problems
    Given a history of system issues
    When the pattern analyzer runs
    Then it should identify common patterns
    And determine root causes
    And suggest systematic fixes

Scenario: Pattern-based improvement
    Given a pattern has been identified
    When implementing improvements
    Then changes should address the root cause
    And prevent similar issues
    And validate the effectiveness of changes
```

**Story 6: Semantic Understanding**
```
As a content manager
I want the system to understand content semantically
So that it can maintain better relationships and consistency

Scenario: Semantic relationship detection
    Given multiple knowledge documents
    When analyzing relationships
    Then semantic connections should be identified
    And implicit relationships discovered
    And knowledge graph updated accordingly

Scenario: Content enhancement
    Given semantic analysis results
    When enhancing content
    Then relevant context should be added
    And cross-references created
    And content clarity improved
```

## Phase 3: Operation Enhancement

### Performance Stories

**Story 7: Resource Optimization**
```
As a system operator
I want optimal resource utilization
So that the system operates efficiently and cost-effectively

Scenario: Load-based optimization
    Given system load metrics
    When resource optimization runs
    Then resource allocation should be adjusted
    And performance maintained
    And costs minimized

Scenario: Performance monitoring
    Given system is operating
    When monitoring performance
    Then bottlenecks should be identified
    And optimization opportunities flagged
    And trend analysis provided
```

### LLM Interaction Stories

**Story 8: Intelligent LLM Usage**
```
As a system architect
I want optimal LLM interaction patterns
So that we get the best results efficiently

Scenario: Call chain optimization
    Given a complex operation
    When planning LLM calls
    Then calls should be optimally sequenced
    And context maintained between calls
    And results validated at each step

Scenario: Handling LLM failures
    Given an LLM call fails
    When the system detects the failure
    Then it should attempt recovery
    And adjust the prompt if needed
    And maintain operation consistency
```

## Phase 4: User Interaction Enhancement

### Feedback Stories

**Story 9: Continuous Improvement**
```
As a system user
I want the system to learn from usage
So that it continuously improves

Scenario: Learning from feedback
    Given user feedback is received
    When processing the feedback
    Then insights should be extracted
    And improvements identified
    And changes validated

Scenario: Adaptation tracking
    Given system changes from feedback
    When measuring improvement
    Then effectiveness should be validated
    And user satisfaction tracked
    And adaptation success measured
```

### Integration Stories

**Story 10: Seamless Integration**
```
As an API user
I want reliable and consistent system interaction
So that I can build dependent systems confidently

Scenario: API stability
    Given system updates occur
    When APIs are called
    Then functionality should be maintained
    And backwards compatibility preserved
    And performance maintained

Scenario: Error handling
    Given an API error occurs
    When handling the error
    Then clear information should be provided
    And recovery steps suggested
    And system state maintained
```

## Implementation Approach

Each story should be:
1. Implemented iteratively
2. Validated against scenarios
3. Tested end-to-end
4. Monitored in production

## Success Criteria

For each enhancement:
1. All scenarios pass
2. Performance metrics met
3. User satisfaction verified
4. System stability maintained

Would you like me to:
1. Add more detailed scenarios?
2. Expand success criteria?
3. Add specific test cases?
4. Detail implementation steps?

This plan focuses on the value and behavior we want to achieve, rather than just technical implementation details.
